            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THomas Walcot, William Hone,</hi> and <hi>John Rouſe,</hi> having been Accuſed to the Kings moſt Honorable Council, by the Diſcoverers of the Plot againſt the Life of His Majeſty, of many Treaſonable purpoſes and intentions, and upon Warrant Iſſued out for that purpoſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, they were on the 12th. of this inſtant <hi>July</hi> brought to the Seſſions houſe in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> and their Arraigned upon the Indictments of High Treaſon found againſt them by the Grand Jury for Conſpiring the Death of the King, and deſigning to raiſe War and Rebellion, and in order thereto procuring Arms, as Blunderbuſſes, Muſquets, Piſtols and the like, to which Indictments they Pleading Not Guilty; whereupon <hi>Thomas Walcot</hi> being ordered to look to his Challenges, in order to excepting againſt the Preemptory number, which is 35, of the Jurors, he made exceptions againſt all ſuch as belonged to the Lieutenancy, but in the end a Jury of 12. Men being ſworn, they were charged with, to try the Iſſue between the King and him, in caſe of his Life and Death: Whereupon Colonel <hi>Rumſie,</hi> M. <hi>Well,</hi> Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> and others, ſwore him preſent at divers Treaſonable Conſpiracies, Conſults, and Traiterous Contrivancies, that he was to Command a Party to deſtroy the Kings Guards, whilſt others Aſſaſſinated the King and Duke, &amp;c. in <hi>February</hi> laſt, at what time they were to return from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and that a Conſult was held to inquire into the day of their return, and that they differed about the particular time, tho afterwards they came to a Reſult, but that the Fire that happened at <hi>Newmarket</hi> fruſtrated the Intention, &amp;c. On the <hi>Friday</hi> following being the 13th. inſtant, <hi>William Hone,</hi> and <hi>John Rouſe,</hi> were Tried for the Like Treaſon in Conſpiring againſt His Majeſty, him to Death, and final Deſtruction to put, &amp;c. againſt whom the Kings Evidence depoſed, firſt, that <hi>Hone</hi> had agreed to be one of the Aſſaſſinates, and was to have a ſumm of Money to buy him Furniture for that purpoſe, as Horſe and Arms, &amp;c. and that he had declared he was to be one that ſhould ſeize the Captain and Lieutenant, and that at another time he declared it would never be well till the <hi>Blackbird</hi> and <hi>Gold-Finch</hi> were knocked on the Head, and that both thoſe Myſterious Expreſſions, he explained himſelf to mean the King and Duke of <hi>York;</hi> theſe and many more

were the circumſtances that occurred upon this and the former Tryal, under the like circumſtances was <hi>John Rouſe</hi> Indicted for High Treaſon and Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Life of the King tending to the ſubverſion of the Government, ſo that in the end after divers Arguments they were found Guilty, and the day following received Sentence to be Drawn, Hanged and Quartered, as the Law in caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction for High Treaſon requires, when deſiring their Friends might viſit them, and time for Repentance allowed, they were remanded to Priſon, where as Men ſenſible of the near approach of their diſſolution they continued, being often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by their Friends and Relations who came to condole their misfortunes, and to comfort them with ſeaſonable admonitions to prepare for a future ſtate, ſeeing their Lives were forfeited by the Law, and that Execution of the Sentence paſſed upon them would not be long deferred, foraſmuch as all hopes of pardon was vaniſhed, and whether a Reprieve for longer Life would be granted to them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained doubtful; the former and the latter being at the pleaſure of His Majeſty, whom they had ſo highly offended; whereupon they taking the cordial advice of thoſe that regarded their happineſs as to the Life to come, ſeriouſly conſidering in what eſtate they remain, and what a large account they were ſhortly to give before the Dreadful Tribunal of all their Actions, inſomuch that at times they were not interrupted by Viſitants, their ſerious thoughts were for the moſt part imployed in Confeſſing their Sins, and begging pardon of God for their Offences, during their abode in <hi>Newgate,</hi> the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> came to viſit them, in order to perſwade them to an ingenious Confeſſion, as far as they were conſcious of the Conſpiracy of which they ſtood Convicted, the ſame Arguments uſed divers other Loyal Perſons, but they ſeemed much reſerved, ſaying, they had been brought to diſgrace, and conſequently to an untimely end, by their too much credulity, and that it was now too late to retrieve what was paſt, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly begged pardon of thoſe they had Offended.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> ſeldom appeared publickly, but kept himſelf to his retirement, either Reading or Converſing with particular Friends that came to take their laſt farewel of him. <hi>John Rouſe</hi> was often obſerved buſie as is ſuppoſed writing for the moſt part, but to what effect remains yet uncertain, unleſs a Petition humbly to beſeech His Majeſty to beſtow his dead Body on his Wife. <hi>William Hone</hi> was moſt dejected of the three, the fear of death having in a manner ſtupified him, in ſo much that he was hardly induced to anſwer to the queſtions demanded of him by ſuch as came to Examine or Diſcourſe him. This and ſuch like was their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, till they had notice that the Warrant was Signed for their Execution, and that they muſt prepare to dye as this day, which heavy tho expected news they received with different paſſions, continuing as Men that devoted to the Grave till this Morning, at what time being put into a Sledg, they were drawn to the place of Execution, attended by a ſtrong Guard of the Sheriffs Men, and Hamblet Wonders.</p>
            <p>About 10 in the Morning <hi>Thomas Walcot, John Rouſe,</hi> and <hi>William Hone</hi> were brought to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the former in a Sledg by himſelf, and the 2 latter in an other Sledg, when being unbound, they were helped into the Cart prepared for that purpoſe, and there for a while convers'd with the Miniſters, who were Dr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white,</hi> and Mr. Ordinary, both of them perſwading them to make an ingenious Confeſſion, according to the beſt of their Knowledg: Whereupon Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> drew out two Papers and ſhewed them to the Miniſters, and thoſe that were in the Cart, ſaying, that he had written them to read publickly, which when he was ordered to do, he with a compoſed Countenance did it Audibly, the firſt was in Nature of a Confeſſion of his Enormities to God, wherein he deſired for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, declaring that he had been a great Sinner, and for that cauſe, God had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35533:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuffered him to perpetrate thoſe Crimes, that had rendered him worthy of Death; deſiring God of his Mercy to forgive him his manifold Offences, and that all the World would forgive him, whom he had offended, putting up divers Ejaculations, deſiring that he might be an Example to warn others from daring to Attempt any Treaſonable Deſign or Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King, after which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper he held in his hand, ſometimes looking on it, and other times not while he was ſpeaking or making his Confeſſion to the People, declaring, that he was Guilty of the Conſpiracy, as to the knowledg thereof, and that he was drawn into the ſaid Conſpiracy by People that promiſed him great things, but that now he plainly perceived there was no Faith in Man, as to the matter of the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination, he confeſſed to have knowledge of it, and that he had been Incited thereto by Evil-affected Perſons, whom he deſired God to forgive, Praying that his and his Fellows preſent, might be the laſt Blood that might be ſhed upon the occaſion of the Conſpiracy he confeſſed he had been at divers Conſults, and that once and no more to his remembrance, he had been in the Company of two Lords, naming divers of the Perſons fled upon the Diſcovery of the Plot, and Conſpiracy, ſaying, they had drawn him unexpectedly into the miſchief, he having not long before arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and that too late, he was conſcious of his too much credulity, which had brought him to his deſerved though ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unexpected End, deſiring of God to proſper, and preſerve the King or to this purpoſe, he alſo ſaid, that when the Conſpiracy was diſcovered, he was promiſed by ſome who had drawn him into it, to be ſafely conveyed into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that when they had decoyed him and were conveying him to Priſon-ward, they told him they deſigned to Ship him, &amp;c. and ſo continued with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential tears to bewail his Crimes and unhappy End, but would not own that he was actually to Kill the King, tho he was to be aſſiſting therein, deſiring the People to obey, and in all Cordial ſincerity endeared themſelves to His Majeſty, who well deſerved the love and tendereſt reſpect of his Subjects, this being the ſubſtance of <hi>Walcots</hi> Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Rouſe</hi> began to make his Confeſſion, when having deſired God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his Sins, he confeſſed that he had been at divers Conſults, and that he was to have Acted, but as to each particular he was Ignorant, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Hone</hi> ſpoke little as to particulars, but in all general confeſſed that he was Guilty of the Conſpiracy, and was to have been one of the number that was to have Aſſaſſinated the King in his return from <hi>New-Market,</hi> and that <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> and others had by many perſwaſions prevailed with him, to undertake what he did, he likewiſe confeſſed he had told Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> he had ſpoke with <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and related to him the meaſures that he was to take, ſaying, that he had agreed to be one in the Aſſaſſination with divers other Circumſtances of which theſe are the moſt material, tho indeed his Diſcourſe was but ſhort in reſpect to the two former.</p>
            <p>The Confeſſions thus made or as near as could be taken, thus or to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Miniſters Prayed with them, and ſung a Pſalm after which, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally deſired to ſay a Prayer of themſelves, which was granted, Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> beginning firſt, who prayed fervently, as being throughly ſenſibly of his Offence, deſiring the Prayers of all good Men, next <hi>Hone</hi> made a Prayer, and afterwards <hi>Rouſe:</hi> Each of them ſeducing greatly to bewail the greatneſs of their Offences, asking forgiveneſs, eſpecially of His Majeſty, againſt whom they had ſo highly Offended, when being asked what further they had to ſay, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired, that God would forgive them, and that all People would take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by them, and not be Inticed or perſwaded to enterprize ſo great a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs as had brought them to ruine, though as they hoped God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their late Repentance, and thoſe that heard them, and beheld their untimely end would take warning thereby, and avoid the like Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Theſe or to this effect they having confeſſed and declared, the Cart was drawn away, and after they had hung 3 quarters of an hour, they were cut down and Quartered one by one, their Bowels Burnt &amp;c. according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance pronounced againſt them.</p>
